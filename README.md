# Smart-attendance-system

The current scenario of taking attendance in  classes is manual, where teachers have to call out names of each student from the list and mark the attendance accordingly. 
This is very tedious for the teachers and also there might be a chance of proxy for the absentees. 
This project proposes a system which will reduce the work of the teacher to a greater extent and also ensure that no proxies are being given. 
The system uses the image of the entire class taken during the class and using multiple face detection recognizes the faces from the image and mark the attendance in an excel sheet. 
Addition of students to the database is done by an admin and the system is used by the teacher during the class which will provide the teacher with an updated excel sheet with the attendance of the students. 
The system is handy and portable to any system which can run python scripts. 
This system saves the valuable time of teaching in the class and is beneficial for both the teacher and the students, allowing them to teach and learn respectively.
